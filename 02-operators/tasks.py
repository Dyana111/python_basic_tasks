'''
#4: create a variable x with value of 10
x=10
#5: increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
x +=5
#6: divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
x /=5
#7: multiply the x on 3 using assignment operators
x *=3
#8: get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
x %=3
#9: using python print the module of 11 to 4
y=11%4
print(y) answer: 3
#10:print the exponent of 2,3
z=2**3
print(z) answer: 8
#11: divide 11 by 3 using python divison
d= 11/3
print (d) answer: 3.666666
#12: can you divide 11 by 3 and get an int number
d= 11//3
print (d) answer: 3
