#1: Create a bool variable named x
x=false
#2:create an integer variable named y
y=30
#3:create a floate variable named z
z=3.6
#4: create a string variable named s
s='diana'
t='talya'
#5:convert the int variable to float
y=30.3
#6: can you convert the str to int
s=30
t=1.6
#7: create a list of number from 1 to 5
l=[1,2,3,4,5]
#8:create a tuple from 10 to 15
tu=(10,11,12,13,14,15)
#9:convert the list to tuple
l=(1,2,3,4,5)
#10: create a dict of 3 values:
d={'raed':33, 'diana':30, 'talya':1.5}
#11: can we use semi colon with python
yes
#12:python is interpreted or compiled
interpreted
#13what is the differences between low level and high level
high level programme languges are easier for the programmers to compiled,
interprete, or understand then machines. have to use a compiler or an
interpreter to translate the code to machines
so the low level languges are easier for machines in comparion of ppl.
low level languges requier an assembler for directly translating the
instructions of the machine language.
