#13:what is the differences between low level and high level
'''
high level programme languges are easier for the programmers to compiled,
interprete, or understand then machines. have to use a compiler or an
interpreter to translate the code to machines. are slower than low level
so the low level languges are easier for machines in comparion of ppl.
low level languges requier an assembler for directly translating the
instructions of the machine language.
